# awsLighsailTwilioWebhook

In this code I use Docker with AWS to upload a server on AWS Lightsail that handles http requests for Twilio via a webhook.

## Usage

./upload is a wrapper script that creates a docker image and uploads it to AWS. All you have to do is start docker, and make sure your code works. I have also built in ngrok into this code so that you can test on your local environment. More documentation on this to come soon.

## License

I have an MIT license so make sure to add this anywhere you'd like to use my code.
